# iCode
***Code on the go***

By Rahil Pasha

## Introduction

iCode is a programing language built on Java and optimized for mobile devices. iCode is written into a simple .txt file and is compiled into Java where it can be run on the JVM.

The basic commands (like getting inputs and printing outputs, creating variables, performing calculations, loops, and if statements) are represented using emojis. There are a total of 10 emoji commands. In combination with letters and numbers, the emojis help developers write iCode on the go.

Whether you're in a car, walking to school or work, standing in line, or lying on your couch, iCode allows you to quickly turn a moment of inspiration into a functional program. Down the line you can compile your code into Java and turn it into a fully fledged application.

## Emoji Library

| Emoji | Function            |
|:-----:|:--------------------|
|  🖨   | Print the output    |
|  🔡   | String key word     |
|  🔢   | int key word        |
|  📦   | Initialize variable |
|  ⌨️   | Get user input      |
|   ❓   | If statement        |
|  🔁   | Loop                |
|  ↪️   | Start code block    |
|  ↩️   | End code block      |
|  📝   | Comments            |

## Usage

To use iCode you first have to create a plain text file (.txt) to write your program. You can use the 10 emoji's above as shown in the example.txt file.

The comment emoji is ignored by the compiler and can be used at the start of any line to document or note something about your code.

To print, select the pinter emoji and then enter the string or int keyword emoji depending on what you want to print.

```
📝 Basic Print Statements
🖨 🔡 Hello World!
🖨 🔢 3 + 5
```
> The code above outputs:
> 
> Hello World!
> 
> 8

Use the box emoji, to initialize a variable as a string or int. After selecting in the box emoji, write the name of the variable followed by the variable type (string or int) and then the value of the variable.

📝 Storing Integers in Variables

📦 b 🔢 2
📦 a 🔢 9
🖨 a + b
```
